# Maker Projects Code Repository
This is the hub for code/documentation for my maker projects.

By that I mean code for different projects for different platforms (microcontrollers/development boards/single board computers).

Instead of having many different small repositories I decided to bundle up them
and move then to one big hub. Hopefully this will make management easier.
This should also simplyfiy making projects as I can categorize simillar projects for different platforms, 
build up upon what I already have and so on (If this makes any sense).

# Projects
- 0x00 LED Blink (Hello, World! of microcontrollers)
  * [in Microchip Studio for ATtiny45 in Assembly](https://github.com/adamszymanowski/MakerProjects/blob/main/ATtiny/0x00-LED-Blink/in-MicrochipStudio-for-ATtiny45/0x00-for-ATtiny45/Documentation.md)
    - NOTE: This works for ATtiny85, and since it's so simple it should work for ATtiny25

- 0x01 8-bit Counter
