# Maker Projects Code Repository
This is the hub for code/documentation for my maker projects.

By that I mean code for different projects for different platforms (microcontrollers/development boards/single board computers).

Instead of having many different small repositories I decided to bundle up them
and move then to one big hub. Hopefully this will make management easier.
This should also simplyfiy making projects as I can categorize simillar projects for different platforms, 
build up upon what I already have and so on (If this makes any sense).
